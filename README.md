# Rscripts
 Random R scripts made while teaching myself R
 
 In 2014/2015 or so, I taught myself to use R because my company couldn't afford Minitab.
 This repository is a collection of scripts I wrote, mostly for fun and learning purposes.
 One or two were written to help a friend with her Grad School work.
 
 I will go back and add comments at some point, but as of now (July 23, 2021) these are as written in 2015.
